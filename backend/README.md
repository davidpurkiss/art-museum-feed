# Backend 

## Split Repo's

## Add configs for various environments

## Update dockerfile to be more suited for production
Use proper permissions
Use cross-env

## Formalise error handling for REST API's and move to common location
Check if the API returns details about 400 requests and include in error messages.

## Explicitly map responses from API to graphQL schema
Would prefer errors and alerts in case of changes to the API rather than silently returning no data.

Add end to end tests using supertest and nmock
